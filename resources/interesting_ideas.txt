One example of an interesting and unorthodox pathfinding algorithm is the "ants on a graph" algorithm, which is based on the behavior of real ants as they search for food. In this algorithm, virtual ants are placed on a graph and are allowed to move randomly, with the probability of moving to a particular node being based on the attractiveness of that node. Over time, the ants will tend to move towards nodes that are closer to the goal, resulting in the formation of a "pheromone" trail that other ants can follow.

Another interesting and unorthodox pathfinding algorithm is the "firefly algorithm", which is based on the behavior of fireflies as they search for mates. In this algorithm, virtual fireflies are placed on a graph and are allowed to move randomly, with the probability of moving to a particular node being based on the brightness of that node. Over time, the fireflies will tend to move towards nodes that are brighter, resulting in the formation of a "light" trail that other fireflies can follow.

In the case of the Japanese train routes, the researchers used a type of slime mold called Physarum polycephalum, which is known for its ability to find the shortest path between multiple food sources. By creating a model of the train network and providing the slime mold with "food" at the locations of different cities, the researchers were able to observe the growth of the slime mold and use it to determine the optimal routes between cities.

This type of nature-inspired algorithm, known as "biological computing", has the potential to provide new solutions to complex problems that may be difficult to solve using traditional methods. While it is not always practical or feasible to use biological systems directly, studying and understanding the behavior of these systems can provide valuable insights and inspiration for developing new algorithms and approaches to problem-solving.
