# Pathfinding Algorithms

This is a Python implementation and visualization of various pathfinding algorithms.

Currently only the A\* path finding algorithm is implemented.

The visualization is implemented using PyGame. Credits to [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A).

## A\* pathfinding algorithm:

The A\* algorithm was created and show [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A) by Tech With Tim.

## Command line arguments

There are two optional command line arguments: width and # rows.

```
width >= 2
rows >= 2
```

```
./pathfinding.py <width> <# rows>
```
